# RNAseq
This R script performs an RNA-seq differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and miodin. It imports count data, infers sample groups, filters low-expression genes, defines an unpaired case-control study, and executes a workflow that includes normalization, PCA, and clustering, with visual outputs and project export.
